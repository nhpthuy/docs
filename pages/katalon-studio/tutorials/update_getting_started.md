   -   Or else, select *Blank* and choose a location to store the project data on your machine.
4. Input in *Description* to describe your project.
5. Choose *Generate gitignore file* and *Generate build.gradle file* if needed; click *OK*. A new project will be generated at specified location.

2. Enter a URL of your web application (e.g., https://amazon.com/) and select a browser to start recording. The browser instance will be launched automatically.

2. Select one of the supported browsers: *Chrome/ Firefox/ IE/ Safari/ Edge Chromium* in the drop-down list next to the *Run* button in the main toolbar to run the script. 

> If you click *Run* without chosing browser, Chrome is set as defaut to execute the test case.

3. Wait for your excution result shown in the *Job Progress* tab. At this stage, the system will execute all your interaction with the web page's elements of the chosen test case.

### **Investigate excution results**

> Katalon Studio provides a *Job Progress* tab to show the status of your execution as well as the *Log Viewer* to let you identify potential problems that may have occurred.

#### **View Execution Log**

Once your excecution is finished, you can review the results on the *Log Viewer* views as below:

#### **Analyze Test Results**

- If your test has **passed**, congratulation.
- If your test has **failed**, have a look at *Log Viewer* and *Console* tabs to know what happened during runtime. You should see the root cause on top of the execution log.
